# BookMyShow Theatre-side README

This README file provides an overview of the theatre-side components for a website similar to BookMyShow. The theatre-side handles the management of theatres, movie scheduling, and ticket availability. Here's a guide to help you understand the structure and functionality of the theatre-side implementation.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios (or any other HTTP client library)
- React Router (for handling routing)
- State management library (e.g., Redux, React Context)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Access to the BookMyShow server-side API (ensure the server-side is running)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookmyshow-theatre.git

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the dependencies:
cd bookmyshow-theatre
npm install

markdown
Copy code

3. Set up the environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Define the following environment variables in the `.env` file:
  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=your-bookmyshow-api-url
  ```

4. Start the development server:
npm start

shell
Copy code

## Project Structure
The theatre-side project structure follows a typical React application layout:

bookmyshow-theatre

│ ├── components
│ │ ├── Header.js
│ │ ├── TheatreList.js
│ │ ├── MovieSchedule.js
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── pages
│ │ ├── Home.js
│ │ ├── TheatreDetails.js

- **components**: Contains reusable UI components.
- **pages**: Defines the main pages of the application, such as Home, TheatreDetails, ScheduleManagement, etc.
- **services**: Contains API service files for making HTTP requests to the server-side API.
- **utils**: Contains utility functions or helper files.
- **App.js**: Entry point of the React application, where routes and main components are defined.
- **index.js**: Entry point for rendering the React application.

## Usage
The theatre-side application provides a user interface for theatre owners/managers to manage their theatres, schedule movies, and manage ticket availability. The application communicates with the server-side API to fetch data and perform operations. Customize the components and pages according to your specific requirements and project structure.

## Deployment
To deploy the theatre-side application, build the optimized production version using the following command:
npm run build

python
Copy code
The build artifacts will be generated in the `build` directory, which can be deployed to a hosting platform of your choice.
